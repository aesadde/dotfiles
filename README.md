# titico's dots

Keeping track of my dotfiles as everybody else.

##Install
Very simplet to install. Clone the repo, run setup.sh 
Should work with no problem, the script is very basic with a few
options of which dotfiles to install and there's also the option
to install my vim config file which is a submodule of this repo.
